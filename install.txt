Installation instruction of Marray toolbox in Matlab Windows version:
1. Unzip marrayv2.ZIP file.
2. Copy marrayV2 to J:matlabR12\toolbox\  (If your Matlab toolbox is installed at here)
3. Copy demo data marrayV2_demodata to J:matlabR12\work\  
   (If your Matlab work path is installed at here)
4. Go to Matlab startup file, normally you will find it in 
   J:matlabR12\toolbox\local\startup.m
   if you did not find startup.m file please save startupsav.m as
   stratup.m
5. Then add the path of Marray toolbox in startup.m
6. For example at here, we add bellow line in startup.m
   path(path,'J:\matlabR12\toolbox\marrayV2')
7. Now Marray become one of Matlab toolbox when you 
   start Matlab in the next time.

Installation instruction of Marray toolbox in Matlab Unix (Linux) version:
1. Unzip marrayv2.ZIP file.
2. Copy marrayV2 to 
   /home/username/matlab_toolbox/  
   (If you want Marray toolbox to be installed at here)
3. Copy demo data marrayV2_demodata to /home/username/  
   (If you want to test the demo data at here)
4. Edit the shell start file, for example for tcsh please
   edit .cshrc file
5. Then add the path of Marray toolbox in this file.
6. For example at here, we add bellow line in .cshrc
   setenv MATLABPATH /home/username/matlab_toolbox/marrayV2/
7. Use source command to reload the .cshrc file, source .cshrc
8. Now Marray become one of Matlab toolbox when you 
   start Matlab in the next time.
